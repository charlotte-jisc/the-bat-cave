    <h1>Animal Behaviour</h1>
    <p>Animal Behaviour:
        How the animal gets food:
        Bats locate each insect by echolocation, then they trap it with their wing or tail membranes and reach down to take the insect into their mouth.
        In addition to moths, bats eat other insects, such as mosquitoes, midges and other flies, mayflies, some beetles, caddis flies, lacewings and other nocturnal insects.
        How the animal protects itself from predators:
        Big brown bats choose secluded roosts to protect themselves from many predators. Young are often taken from maternity roosts by snakes, raccoons, and cats if they fall. Flying bats are sometimes captured by owls and falcons as they leave their roosts.
        Bats are quite timid; however, they will defend themselves.
        For protection they fly out at night is another way for them to protect themselves and also it eliminates the encounter of them with hawks, falcons, and including other predators.
        Sleeping habits:
        During the day bats sleep in trees, rock crevices, caves, and buildings. Bats are nocturnal (active at night), leaving daytime roosts at dusk.
        Bats famously sleep hanging upside down. This adaptation allows them to huddle closely together for protection against cold and predators, and it enables individuals to expend less energy when taking flight. </p>
