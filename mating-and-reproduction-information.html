    <p>Mating & reproductive information
        What is the gestational period of the animal?
        A batâ€™s pregnancy lasts between six and nine weeks. The length of the pregnancy depends on the species and can be influenced by weather, climate and availability of food.
        How many offspring does it typically have at a time?
        Bats usually give birth to a single baby (called a pup) each year. They keep their babies close and nurture them carefully.
        How long do the offspring live with the parent?
        The young bats are suckled by their mothers for four to five weeks until they are old enough to fly. They then begin to venture out from the roost to forage for food.</p>
