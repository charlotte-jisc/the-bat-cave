    <h1>Animal Habitat</h1>
    <p>· Bats live all over the place in the United States, Puerto Rico, and even the U.S. Virgin Islands. And guess what? There's a special bat called the Hawaiian hoary bat that's the only native, land-loving mammal in Hawaii! You can even find bats in faraway Alaska.</p>
    <p>· Bats are like adventure explorers. They can live in lots of different homes, like deserts, forests, neighborhoods, caves, and even in big cities. They like to roost, which means make their homes, in all sorts of places, like trees, caves, buildings, bridges, and even the attic of a house! In Texas, there's a super big colony of bats that lives under a bridge called Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin during the summer. More than 1.5 million bats make it their summer home!</p>
    <p>· Bats are pretty clever when it comes to staying warm. Some, like the big brown bat and the eastern red bat, take long naps in caves and trees during the cold winter. But if the day is warm, you might spot them flying around. And some bats like to fly to warmer places or even go to a cozy cave when it gets chilly. Bats are like nature's little travellers!</p>
