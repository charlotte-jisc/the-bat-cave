    <h1>Animal Habitat</h1>
    <p>Bats are found throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Hawaiian hoary bat is the only native, terrestrial mammal on the Hawaiian Islands. Bats can even be found in Alaska.
        Bats can be found in almost every type of habitat. They live in deserts, woodlands, suburban communities, caves, and cities. Bats make their homes (roosts) in a variety of different structures. They can use trees, caves, cracks in buildings, bridges, and even the attic of a house. The largest urban colony of bats in the U.S. lives under Austin, Texas' Congress Avenue Bridge during the summer. The Congress Avenue Bridge becomes a temporary home to more than 1.5 million Brazilian free-tailed bats.
        Bats typically prefer warmer temperatures, and they have several ways of dealing with the cold. Some bats, including the big brown bat and the eastern red bat, hibernate in caves and trees to survive the winter. They can sometimes be seen flying around on warm winter days. Many bats migrate to warmer climates or even to a nearby cave.</p>
