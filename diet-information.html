    <p>Diet information
        All UK bats eat insects. Each species has its favourite types and hunts them in its own special way. Most insects are caught and eaten in mid-air, though bats sometimes find it easier to hang up to eat larger prey. All bats have very big appetites, because flying uses up lots of energy.
        A single little brown bat, which has a body no bigger than an adult human's thumb, can eat 4 to 8 grams (the weight of about a grape or two) of insects each night.</p>
