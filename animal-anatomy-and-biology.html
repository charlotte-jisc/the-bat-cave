    <p>How bats breathe?
        Bats possess a highly adapted respiratory system to cope with the demands of powered flight, an energetically taxing activity that requires a large continuous throughput of oxygen. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are larger than in most other small quadrupedal mammals.
        How long do bats live?
        Although most bats live less than 20 years in the wild, scientists have documented six species that life more than 30 years. In 2006, a tiny bat from Siberia set the world record at 41 years. The Townsend's big-eared bat's average lifespan is 16 years.

    <p>Height/weight/general size of bats:
        The smallest bat is the size of a small mouse; the largest, a fruit eater, has a 6-foot wingspan.
        Bats can be as large as a small dog or as small as a bee. The largest bats are the flying foxes with wingspans of up to 2 metres and a body weights of up to 1.5 kilograms. At the other end of the scale is the bumblebee bat, weighing only 2 grams – the world’s smallest mammal!
        Significant or unique physical characteristics:
        Bats come in several colors, including black, brown, red, tan, and gray. In general, they have short snouts, large ears like a rodent, and fur-covered torsos.</p>
